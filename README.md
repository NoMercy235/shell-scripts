Shell Scripts
==================================

This repo serves as storage for all my shell scripts. Nothing to do here. :-?

Dependencies
------------

Almost all the important stuff here can be safetly started as a Docker container. Therefore, the only real dependency is Docker itself, but, if you want the "full" experience, you should also install Node. I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for easy Node version management.

Also, don't forget to change the path of the crontab scripts if they are found in another place than what's specified.
