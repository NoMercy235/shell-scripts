Shell Scripts
==================================

This repo serves as storage for all my shell scripts and workflow of the VPS.

Dependencies
------------

Almost all the important stuff here can be safetly started as a Docker container. Therefore, the only real dependency is Docker itself, but, if you want the "full" experience, you should also install Node. I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for easy Node version management.

Also, don't forget to change the path of the crontab scripts if they are found in another place than what's specified.

The filestructure I'm using is this:

`~/shell/...` is mapped to this repository

The other projects should be found in `~/projects/...`
