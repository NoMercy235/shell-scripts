These scripts are used to manage the SSL certifications of my VPS. The renew-all-certs.sh script was custom-made for the server so it cannot be reused, but all the other can be used in other circumstances.

The only dependency of these scripts is [Cerbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). Installation and documentation can be found on their site.
